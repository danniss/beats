# Beats - The Lightweight Shippers of the Elastic Stack

The [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats) are lightweight data
shippers, written in Go, that you install on your servers to capture all sorts
of operational data (think of logs, metrics, or network packet data).

This is forked from beats 5.3.

the only purpose here is to make filebeat send globed strings as "prefix".
